# EmissionFactors
A set of MATLAB code for organising traffic emission factors.


## Data
### Dutch emission factors
Dutch emission factors are taken from published spreadsheets downloaded from the Dutch government at http://tinyurl.com/EF-NonMotorway and http://tinyurl.com/EF-Motorway for the non-motorway and mororway traffic respectively. They are updated anually and should therefore be periodically updated. The current set were downloaded on the 30th November 2016.
